## Hello! Nice to meet you, I'm Anne. I have a degree in IT technician, an undergraduate student - Bachelor of Information Systems - and a great student. My main interest currently is to grow in my field, deepening my knowledge to start projects and work. My biggest wish is to be able to participate in a Technology event or training. I have made an effort to stay up to date with advances, especially those relating to my area of â€‹â€‹expertise. I would like to learn more about AIs but I don't know where to start. Bye byeðŸ‘‹
