## Hello! Nice to meet you, I'm Anne. I have a degree in IT technician, an undergraduate student - Bachelor of Information Systems. My main interest currently is to grow in my field, deepening my knowledge to start projects and work. My biggest wish is to be able to participate in a Technology event or training. I have made an effort to stay up to date with advances, especially those relating to my area of â€‹â€‹expertise. Bye byeðŸ‘‹
